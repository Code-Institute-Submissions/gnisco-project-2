## Description

In this project I have created a website to help users find a suitable Electric Vehicle for them and to provide them with the locations of where they can find/buy their chosen vehicle.

This is necessary as the future of the cars market is electric and at them moment there are numerous benefits for switching from a internal combustion engine to a electric motor powered car, for instannce the government grants that are given (up to Â£3,500), also in the UK there are now a growing number of rapid charge stations for electric vehicles meaning it is easier to travel long distance with them than ever before.

## UX

This website is designed for people who are looking for a new Electric Vehicle and what to see a website that compares most of the vehicles available to purchase now or pre-order for the future. It shows that there are quite a few types of electric vehicles available and helps the user to choose the best one to suit their current needs whether they need something that can go a long time without needing to be charged or just a small city run around ev.
